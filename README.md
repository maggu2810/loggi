* C++ pre-C++98: __cplusplus is 1.
* C++98: __cplusplus is 199711L.
* C++98 + TR1: This reads as C++98 and there is no way to check that I know of.
* C++11: __cplusplus is 201103L.
* C++14: __cplusplus is 201402L.
* C++17: __cplusplus is 201703L.
* C++20: __cplusplus is 202002L.
* C++23: __cplusplus is 202302L.
